# Final_Project_Travel



## Questions for this project

For this project, we are trying to answer questions related to taking a vacation in a big city. The first question that a tourist should look at is when to go, so our first question is “What month would be the best time to visit this city?”

From there, we want to answer some questions about where to go while in this city. We further divided this question into two categories. First, we look at the popular sightseeing places or fun activities in the city. We wanted to visualize this on a map while also being able to sort by category to focus on what our tourist is interested in. That is best asked as “What attractions are available and how can they be sorted?”

We also realized that good restaurants are important in planning, so we also want to show “What restaurants are in the area and how good are they?”
